# NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT

The OPC Foundation, a non-profit corporation (the "OPC Foundation"), has
established a set of specifications intended to foster greater interoperability
between automation/control applications, field systems/devices, and
business/office applications in the process control industry.

The OPC specifications define standard interfaces, objects, methods, and
properties for servers of real-time information like distributed process
systems, programmable logic controllers, smart field devices and analyzers. The
OPC Foundation distributes specifications, prototype software examples and
related documentation (collectively, the "OPC Materials") to its members in
order to facilitate the development of OPC compliant applications.

The OPC Foundation will grant to you (the "User"), whether an individual or
legal entity, a license to use, and provide User with a copy of, the current
version of the OPC Materials so long as User abides by the terms contained in
this Non-Exclusive License Agreement ("Agreement"). If User does not agree to
the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the OPC Materials may not
be used, and all copies (in all formats) of such materials in User's possession
must either be destroyed or returned to the OPC Foundation. By using the OPC
Materials, User (including any employees and agents of User) agrees to be bound
by the terms of this Agreement.

All OPC Materials, unless explicitly designated otherwise, are only available to
currently registered members of the OPC Foundation (an "Active Member"). If the
User is not an employee or agent of an Active Member then the User is
prohibited from using the OPC Materials and all copies (in all formats) of such
materials in User's possession must either be destroyed or returned to the OPC
Foundation.

## LICENSE GRANT

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the OPC Foundation
hereby grants to User a non-exclusive, royalty-free, limited license to use,
copy, display and distribute the OPC Materials in order to make, use, sell or
otherwise distribute any products and/or product literature that are compliant
with the standards included in the OPC Materials. User may not distribute OPC
Materials outside of the Active Member organization to which User belongs
unless the OPC Foundation has explicitly designated the OPC Material for public
use.

All copies of the OPC Materials made and/or distributed by User must include
all copyright and other proprietary rights notices included on or in the copy
of such materials provided to User by the OPC Foundation.

The OPC Foundation shall retain all right, title and interest (including,
without limitation, the copyrights) in the OPC Materials, subject to the
limited license granted to User under this Agreement.

The following additional restrictions apply to all OPC Materials that are
software source code, libraries or executables:

1. User is requested to acknowledge the use of the OPC Materials and provide a
   link to the OPC Foundation home page *www.opcfoundation.org* from the
   *About* box of the User's or Active Member's application(s).

2. User may include the source code, modified source code, built binaries or
   modified built binaries within User's own applications for either personal
   or commercial use. However, the source code, modified source code, built
   binaries or modified built binaries cannot be sold as is, either
   individually or together.

In other words, User may use OPC Foundation software to enhance the User's
applications and to ensure compliance with the various OPC specifications. User
is prohibited from gaining commercially from the OPC software itself.
